# TrustMeGit

**Skip Git hooks with style. Commit and push with `--no-verify` directly from VSCode. Trust me, I know what I‚Äôm doing.**

## üöÄ What is TrustMeGit?

`TrustMeGit` is a lightweight VSCode extension that adds quick actions to **commit** and **push** your code using the `--no-verify` flag ‚Äî bypassing Git hooks like linters, tests, or any custom scripts that would normally block the action.

It's perfect for those moments when you just *know* what you're doing, and need to get the job done fast.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Commit with `--no-verify` from the command palette or button
- Push with `--no-verify` easily
- Avoid those annoying hook-related blocks when you're sure your code is fine
- Works seamlessly with your existing Git setup in VSCode

## üß© Why?

Git hooks are great. They catch bugs and enforce standards.  
But sometimes... you just need to bypass them. Maybe:
- You're working on a WIP branch
- The hook is failing for the wrong reasons
- You just need to ship now and fix later

That‚Äôs where **TrustMeGit** comes in.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Go to the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) and search for `TrustMeGit`
2. Click **Install**
3. Done!

## üí° Usage

- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
